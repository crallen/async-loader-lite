# Async Loader Lite #

Small utility script that loads jQuery and the AmeriCommerce JavaScript API asynchronously. The minified version of this script is used in all AmeriCommerce JavaScript API embed snippets generated via the Embed Generator that was introduced in 2012.6.

The ready-to-use minified file is included in the dist directory.
